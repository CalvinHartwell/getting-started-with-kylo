# Installing Kylo

Kylo is distributed as a Virtual Appliance and in RPM format. Hopefully in the future there will also be a .deb release for Debian and official yum repositories to download the software. There are also plans for a .tar release if for some reason you don't want to use the package manager.

In this section we cover the basic installation of Kylo using the Kylo RPM and then cover how to build the Kylo RPM from source. Building the Kylo RPM can be useful for development, debugging and testing Kylo.
