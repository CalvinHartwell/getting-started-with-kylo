# Getting Started With Kylo

A free book which provides an introduction to Kylo and NiFi without going into as much detail as the Kylo manual.

This guide assumes you have a basic knowledge of *nix systems and are able to use SSH.

The book also includes some basic AWS and Hadoop (HDP from Horton Works).
